<h1>Make something good happen in your neighbourhood</h1>

<h2>
  Neighbourhoods are better when people play, learn and work together.
</h2>

<p>
  Connect with people in your neighbourhood to make it a place to be proud of. And if there’s already something good going on, get help to get involved.

  <h2>Why Co-op?</h2>
  <p>
    Co-op has always stood for self-help and solidarity. It’s our job to find new ways to support people, so that they can build a better world - for themselves.
